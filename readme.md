# NoBarriers Technology Co., Ltd.

NoBarriers Technology Co., Ltd. is a high-tech enterprise focused on the field of neuroelectric signal human-computer interaction. The company is dedicated to applying the combination of bioelectric signal and artificial intelligence algorithms to the field of human-computer interaction. With independently developed neuroelectric signal acquisition modules, bioelectric signal acquisition chips, and signal processing algorithms, the company has constructed a leading comprehensive bioelectric signal acquisition and recognition system in China.

## Core Competitive Technologies

The company possesses significant core competitive strengths in the field of neuroelectric interaction technology, including:

- **Self-developed Neuroelectric Signal Acquisition Modules**: Developed neuroelectric signal acquisition equipment with a sampling rate ranging from 200-2000Hz, capable of collecting high-precision electromyography (EMG) signals. The number of acquisition channels can be adjusted to suit various application scenarios.
- **Data Processing and Deep Learning Recognition Algorithms**: The algorithms can quickly filter out data that meets the requirements, remove abnormal information, and retain as much effective neuroelectric data as possible. Based on the accumulated large-scale EMG data, a myoelectric action recognition paradigm has been completed, which can accurately recognize EMG signals of various scenes, actions, and intensities.
- **Neuroelectric Decomposition Algorithm**: The proprietary algorithm can decompose EMG into multiple-channel Motor Unit (MU) information, improving the performance by 15% over traditional blind source separation algorithms.
- **Extendable Acquisition Structure Design**: Advanced extendable conductive materials are used to solve the elasticity issues of electrodes and transmission leads.

## Products and Services

NoBarriers Technology's product line covers a full range of solutions from hardware devices to software algorithms, including but not limited to:

- **Comprehensive Bioelectric Signal Acquisition System**: The SHOWING system, including both software and hardware solutions, has completed the acquisition of over 10 million neuroelectric data entries, building a large-scale unified scheme EMG dataset.
- **Virtual Hand**: Calculates 21 degrees of freedom of hand key points through sensor data to synchronize the hand state into the virtual world.
- **Input Method**: An input method based on myoelectric and neuroelectric signals, providing an efficient interaction method not limited by external scenarios.
- **Micro-movement Interaction**: Controls the visual interface through small hand movements, providing core interaction technology for wearable mobile scenarios.
- **Electromyography Action Recognition System**: Utilizes deep learning algorithms to complete electromyography action recognition and improve recognition accuracy.

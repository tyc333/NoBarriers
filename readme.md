# NoBarrier.ai Technology Co., Ltd.

NoBarrier.ai Technology Co., Ltd. is a high-tech enterprise focused on the field of neuroelectric signal human-computer interaction. The company is dedicated to applying the combination of bioelectric signal and artificial intelligence algorithms to the field of human-computer interaction. With independently developed neuroelectric signal acquisition modules, bioelectric signal acquisition chips, and signal processing algorithms, the company has constructed a leading comprehensive bioelectric signal acquisition and recognition system in China.

## Core Competitive Technologies

The company possesses significant core competitive strengths in the field of neuroelectric interaction technology, including:

- **Self-developed Neuroelectric Signal Acquisition Modules**: Developed neuroelectric signal acquisition equipment with a sampling rate ranging from 200-2000Hz, capable of collecting high-precision electromyography (EMG) signals. The number of acquisition channels can be adjusted to suit various application scenarios.
- **Data Processing and Deep Learning Recognition Algorithms**: The algorithms can quickly filter out data that meets the requirements, remove abnormal information, and retain as much effective neuroelectric data as possible. Based on the accumulated large-scale EMG data, a myoelectric action recognition paradigm has been completed, which can accurately recognize EMG signals of various scenes, actions, and intensities.
- **Neuroelectric Decomposition Algorithm**: The proprietary algorithm can decompose EMG into multiple-channel Motor Unit (MU) information, improving the performance by 15% over traditional blind source separation algorithms.
- **Extendable Acquisition Structure Design**: Advanced extendable conductive materials are used to solve the elasticity issues of electrodes and transmission leads.

## Milestones

- **Company Establishment**: Founded in 2017, Nuo Bai Ai has been at the forefront of neuroelectric interaction technology.
- **First Product Launch**: The first generation of the company's product, BandV2.0, was launched in January 2018, marking a significant milestone in the company's journey to innovate in the field of human-computer interaction.
- **Patent Achievement**: In 2019, the company was granted an invention patent for "A Connecting Structure of an Eight-Channel Armband Device," showcasing its commitment to innovation and technological advancement.
- **Global Recognition**: In 2017, Nuo Bai Ai secured the first place in the United Nations Innovation Challenge, an accolade that underscores the company's global impact and recognition in the field of innovation.
